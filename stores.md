Here are a few stores that are great to go and rent your first instrument. It is important to go to a string store because they know how to properly measure you for an instrument that will fit you. If you get something that is too small or too big, it can result in tension and possible injury (yes you can get injured playing an instrument just as you can playing a sport).

I recommend renting when you first start because depending on your size will depend on what size of instrument you will get. Renting allows you to trade in as you move up on sizes and gives you the opporunity to learn about what you like and dislike in an instrument. I say wait until you have a couple of years of experience and are ready for a full size instrument. I either use or have had other students use these stores and have not had any troubles with them or the quality of their instruments.
