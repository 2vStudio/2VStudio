**Studio Policies effective as of Sept. 1st, 2014**

####**INDIVIDUAL LESSON RATES:**
* 30 minutes - $25.00 (beginner and elementary age only)
* 45 minutes - $35.00
* 60 minutes - $50.00
 
####**TUITION:**
Tuition is due at the first lesson of each month. Parent(s)/student(s) pay for the number of lessons within that month. The number of lessons is determined by the teacher's schedule. If payment is not made by the first lesson of the up-coming month, a $25.00 late fee will be charged.
 
####**CANCELLATIONS / MAKE-UP LESSONS:**
Students are allowed ONE make-up lesson per quarter (quarters are Jan – March, April – June, July – Sept. and Oct. – Dec.), provided the parent(s)/student(s) call with at least 24 hours notice. If the teacher needs to reschedule a lesson, she will either provide a make-up lesson as soon as possible or a credit will be issued for the following month.
 
Please remember to look at your schedules when the teacher sends out monthly invoices.  If there is a day that you know will not work, it can be rescheduled or canceled before the tuition due date.  Once the due date for tuition has arrived, no more last minute changes can be made unless they fall into the quarterly rule listed above.
 
If you / or your child decide to quit in the middle of the month and do not finish out your month of paid lessons, there will not be a refund of remaining lessons left in that month.
 
####**SICK POLICY:**
If the student is sick, please DO NOT attend lessons. Coming to lessons sick not only puts the teacher at risk, but also puts her family and any other students at risk that the sick student comes into contact. If the student is visibly sick, the teacher has the right to send the student home without lesson. Please do not come to lesson if the student has a cough, runny nose, stomach illness, has not broken a fever for more than 24 hours and / or the student or someone in their home has the flu.
 
####**PLEASE NOTE:**
30-minute lessons are only available for trial lessons, beginners of any age for one year, and for all students of elementary school age. The teacher reserves the right to dismiss any student from her studio who consistently fails to practice, attend their lessons regularly, or abuse the policies written above. This would be a last resort after much communication with the parent and student (or with just the student if they are an adult student).
